!!! CRITICAL ERROR !!!

The application is NOT running because the dependencies are missing.
The folder "node_modules" does not exist.

REASON:
Node.js was not found on your system.

SOLUTION:
1. Download Node.js from https://nodejs.org/ (LTS Version).
2. Install it and check "Add to PATH".
3. RESTART your computer (Important!).
4. Double-click "run_app.bat" in this folder.

If "run_app.bat" closes immediately, it means Node is still not found.
